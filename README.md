## Overview
Recommendation Engine created as an AI module integrated with mobile app to recommend movies with help content, Developed these POC for to get experience real time projects and Created API using Streamlit Framework and Deployed to the Heroku Cloud platform

## Motivation
What to do when you are at home due to this pandemic situation? I started to learn Machine Learning model to get most out of it. I came to know mathematics behind all supervised models and unspurervised models. Finally it is important to work on application (real world application) to actually make a difference. To get a experience you have to work thats the reason to perform my favourable work done.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.9 If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:

     Step 1: pip install -r requirements.txt
     
     Step 2: Streamlit run app.py

## Deployement on Heroku
Login or signup in order to create virtual app. You can either connect your github profile or download ctl to manually deploy this project.

## How Cosine Similarity works?

Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar the documents are irrespective of their size. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The cosine similarity is advantageous because even if the two similar documents are far apart by the Euclidean distance (due to the size of the document), chances are they may still be oriented closer together. The smaller the angle, higher the cosine similarity.
